# Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird is a game that makes me know the career of a programmer. This is a game created by a Vietnamese programmer named Nguyen Ha Dong, I know this game through a TV program on VTV3 called "Blue Bird Award" where programmers creative Vietnamese members bring their products closer to the audience.

After taking a Unity tutorial on youtube I taught myself how to remake this game.

Press the space button to move the bird up and down over the obstacles to accumulate points.

 If the bird hits an obstacle or falls to the ground, you lose.
